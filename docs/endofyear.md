## End of year

To run the archive process, you have to connect an user with the ```diary.manageHistory.apply```right.

And just call the following url (change the year label):
```
http://{{enturl}}/diary/history/create?yearLabel=2016-2017
```

** /!\ this call will run the archive for all database, not only for the current user's structure.**

** Run only on time the url! **
